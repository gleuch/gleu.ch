     <h3>About</h3>
     <p class="medium serif">Zagat wanted to build a web site application that would track the locations of food trucks and allow visitors to filter search results through cuisine, Zagat rating, and proximity. What we delivered was a great, full-screen map that integrated with a large number of food trucks to allow hungry visitors to find their nearby favorite food trucks.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="solution paragraph c">
     <h3>Solution</h3>
     <p class="medium serif">One of the biggest challenges to solve is getting food trucks to announce their openings and locations. With all the available technologies, we chose to have food trucks send out a location-aware tweet. These tweets were scraped through Twitter's API, determined their open status, a location derived from their plan, and marked on a map. However, some food trucks had semi-permanent locations, in which a online schedule was built to accommodate those food trucks.</p>
     <p class="medium serif">In the end, over 30 food trucks in NYC were participating on the launch of the site, attracting attention for its ease-of-use for lunch-time works wanting a great snack nearby.</p>
