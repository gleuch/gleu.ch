     <h3>Challenge</h3>
     <p class="medium serif">Maintaining one site is difficult, but keeping the code consistent between two unique web sites requires dedicated teamwork. Satsuma approached us to redesign and develop AuburnArt.com and its larger sister, CollegeFootballArt.com. They wanted to keep the core customer and administrative features on the site similar. The front-end differences, however, required a some impressive plays. CollegeFootballArt.com not only had 40 teams to manage, but each team section required themeing based on the team's colors.</p>
